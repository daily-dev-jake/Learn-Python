# Learn-Python
Python projects while learning

## Learning Journey:
### Using PCDIT framework
- #### Problem Definition
	- Identify the types of inputs and outputs (I/O) and summarise in natural language what it is that needs to be solved (e.g. “take a single string of any text, then return the reverse of that string of text as output”). 
	- Provide more detail on the kind of data involved in both the input and the output
	- How it can be represented in the program. 
	- Summarize problem statement within one statement
	
- #### Cases
	- Conceptualise the abstract steps from concrete inputs to respective outputs
	- Freedom to step back and revise their problem definitions

- #### Design of Algorithm
    - Use conditional cases to account for all possible outcomes (outputs)
    - Try to start from high level and identify repeating steps to use functions/classes to simplify code
    - Then work on individual conditions

- #### Implementation
    - Using Algorithm design to implement on actual code

- #### Testing
    - Test snippets of code to ensure it covers all types inputs and sequence of events.
